# Node TCP Chat

This is a very basic tcp chat room built with Node.

To run: `$ node chat.js`

To enter the chat space: `$ telnet 127.0.0.1 9000`

For the best experience, enjoy this with multiple terminals.

This was code I played around with by following along with O'Reilly's [Node Up
and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920015956.do).
